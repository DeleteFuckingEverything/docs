# Virtual World.

## Social Media

In accordance with the DFE mantra, if you want to remain anonymous online, begin by deleting your sociall media accounts. Don't just stop using your accounts, purge the data entirely. This includes accounts you haven't used in years, like your LinkedIn account from 10 years ago. Every piece of data related to you on the internet can be aggregated and used to build a better picture of who you are, so every possible piece should be located and eradicated if you want maximum anonymity.

If you feel the need to retain some repository of information about yourself, whether for your own reference or for family members and friends, consider creating a private network using something like Mastodon. You will have complete control over your data, including what is shared and who it is shared with.[ยน](virtual-world..md#references)

## Mail

Ordering items online is an opening to expose your physical location to the entire world. Even a trusted, privacy-conscious retailer can be breached by attackers, and your address could be exposed via an exfiltrated database.
