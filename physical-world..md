Maintaining privacy in real life is much more difficult than doing so virtually. You can be followed, you can be observed remotely with binoculars, you can have trackers installed on your vehicle... there is an endless list of potential ways you can be monitored "IRL" (**I**n **R**eal **L**ife). This page is meant to be a guide on mitigating the effectiveness of conventional monitoring techniques and maintaining a semblance of privacy as you go about your day.

### Predictability

With adequate time dedicated to observation, the vast majority of humans are incredibly predictable. With this in mind, analyze your own daily schedule and try to see yourself from the outside. You probably work the same hours, on the same days of the week, getting to and from work via the same route.

Mix it up.

Shake off potential outside observation by switching up your schedule. Don't take the same route to work every day, add some slight variation to there is no guarantee of your location at a specific time. If your career allows it, leave for work earlier some days and later on others, instead of leaving the house at 08:15 on the dot every weekday.
