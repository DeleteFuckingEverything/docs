# Reclaim Your Privacy.

This idea was spawned from the movie "[Anon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5397194/plotsummary/#synopsis)", which is based around a futuristic "utopia" (dystopia) where every waking moment is recorded and uploaded to the internet. Law enforcement officials are able to access this footage, but so are talented hackers, who use it for their own personal gain.

The protagonist, a girl known only as _Anon_, uses her technical prowess to hide her identity and make herself invisible to the system. Her mantra, the name of our organization, is "Delete fucking everything." At the end of the film, trying to understand her motivations, another character asked what she had to hide. Her answer was resoundingly impactful:

> It's not that I have something to hide. I have nothing I want you to see.

In the United States, an individual's right to privacy is extrapolated from the Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals in their persons, homes, papers, and effects from "unreasonable searches and seizures" by the government.[¹](./#references) While the exact language is not universal, over 150 national constitutions mention the right to privacy.[²](./#references)
