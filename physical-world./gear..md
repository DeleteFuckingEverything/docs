## Faraday Backpack

The [Faraday Backpack](https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Pocket-Faraday-Waterproof-Backpack/dp/B07CRP85PR?&\_encoding=UTF8\&tag=ajmeese-20\&linkCode=ur2\&linkId=bfd88a1369df1c7171315ec88a159a53\&camp=1789\&creative=9325) is a traveler's best friend. The bag comes with inline wireless shielding technology that will entirely prevent your devices from communicating with the outside world. Putting your phone and laptop in the pack will ensure that nobody is able to digitally track your location, further reducing your virtual footprint and eliminating a way that someone can monitor you.
